# Story
## EP - 1: Heartbreaking news
Akio and Aoi are twins. They are high schoolers (1st year). Their parents were out shopping. They were going back home along with their friends Yuto Araki and Ayame Sano. All 4 of their houses were beside each others'. When infront of Akio's home, they saw a cop. They asked what happened when the cop explained that their parents got caught in a cross-fire at the mall. They also asked for forgiveness because they couldn't find their bodies at all, as a matter of fact, they found no bodies at the mall but the mall was totally destroyed. Such a devastating situation, but they also didn't have any close relatives whom they could contact. So just devastated in that situation, they just went home and thought of what to do for the day. Akio made the dinner while Aoi was just in her room in a shock. They ate dinner and went to sleep. In the middle of the night, they heard a huge explosion. They went out of their home and saw Yuto's house on fire. Yuto opened the glass of his front window and threw something. Akio caught it and when the firefighters arived, they also didn't find Yuto's whereabouts. When they woke up from sleep (it was a weekend), they first tried to figure out what the thing was that Yuto threw at them. They saw that there was a button in it. Very carefully, they pressed the button and threw it away. They were right. Some what of a portal appeared infront of them. It felt very weird so they went close step by step, but once they got close enough, the portal sucked them both in and they arrived at a huge green land. They saw someone else there who seemed to be travelling. They went to ask him where they were, but when he got close enough, that person pulled out his sword and pointed at them, saying who they were. Explaining everything that happened, the traveller fortunately understood what happened and said that they were in a parallel universe, in a parallel dimension. They found it pretty weird, but they found him very friendly and thought he gave off a similar vibe as someone else. Not replying anymore, they followed him. [name revealed in ep2]
